# Anagrammer with dictionary validity and definition retrieval project

The idea is to bring together an anagrammer of words with 7 letters(to start with and thinking about scrabble) with the checking of a dictionary (in French to start with but could be expanded consequently to most latin letters based languages) and having the dictionary definitions returned.
