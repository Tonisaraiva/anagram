Finished project aim: Develop an anagrammer for french words which can be used for scrabble and provide word definition

Phase one: get dictionary and user input to select word from dictionary
steps:
- find a scrabble dictionary api ❌
- alternative find a normal french dictionary api :heavy_check_mark:
- create project basic files (html, css, js) :heavy_check_mark:
- get data from the api :heavy_check_mark:
- get data test to display on html :heavy_check_mark:
- get input box for user input :heavy_check_mark:
- get submit button to action user input :heavy_check_mark:
- create eventlistener on user submission :heavy_check_mark:
- call api on user input request :heavy_check_mark:
- retrieve correct info and display on page :heavy_check_mark:
- basic styling of page :heavy_check_mark:
- if word not valid return "please type a valid word" "word not in the dictionary" ❌

Phase 2: develop an anagram generator
steps:
- go through a string and make individual letters in an array :heavy_check_mark:
- combine these letters to create different new strings :heavy_check_mark:
- remove duplicate strings :heavy_check_mark:
- display list of strings on html ❌
- get the input from user ❌

Phase 3: link up dictionary and anagram generator
steps:
- get user input to first generate anagrams ❌
- constrain input to 7 letters only ❌
- check anagrams against dictionary list ❌
- display only valid ones ❌

Phase 4: develop scrabble french dictionary database on heroku
steps:
- find scrabble dictionary ❌
- if not develop one from different sources :heavy_check_mark:
- create local database with it :heavy_check_mark:
- check anagrams from that database ❌
- move database from local to heroku ❌
- check anagrams from that new location ❌

Phase 5: link up previous development to new dictionary database instead of provided api
steps:
- set up REST API ❌


Phase 6: add other langauge scrabble dictionaries
